llm integration failing
permission denied when hitting vertex ai
credentials enabled
fixed: by passing looking trying the api on google cloud and clicking get code
solution v=  client = genai.Client(
      vertexai=True,
      project="eat-good-vsion",
      location="us-central1",
  )

  backend is working note that in gpt_handler, we do not need the api key as google no longer uses it for authentication, 
  initialise the project and pass the project name

  backend improvement suggestions
  Add Rate Limiting:
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
Add API key validation
Add Caching:
Cache API responses
Cache user profiles
Add Input Validation:
Add Pydantic models for request validation
Add file size limits
Add file type validation
Add Monitoring:
Add metrics collection
Add performance monitoring



# i have added a frontend using react.js and node.js the frontend interfaces with the backend using fast api
we started with the backend. the backend 
created a google cloud project. which uses two google ml api's 
vertex ai and gemini flash 2.0
next we build a processor, the processes the image to be passed to the gemini vision api
the vision api scans the product and extract all the text that was passed
the parsed text along with a predefined prompt  is sent to gemini, gemini returns nutrition facts, nutrition score calories and suggestions
The backend and the frontend communicates using fastapi
we Implement logging 
we have added a new camera functionality for real time capture
next steps
write manuscript
prepare presentation
keep adding improvement
improve prompt in case image is not food related
collect user profile for better personalised analysis
think deployment

to use project; start the backend server "python backend/app/main.py
then start the frontend npm install; npm run dev
